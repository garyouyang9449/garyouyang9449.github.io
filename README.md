## Intorduction and Background
> If it ain't broke don't fix it

I am currently a Junior studying Math - Computer Science at UC San Diego. My background is primarily in backend development, and I have experience in different programming languages, including Java, Python, C, C++, and SQL. I also have experience working with Amazon web services. Last summer, I worked as a software engineer intern at a startup, where I wrote and deployed Node.js async backend code and Serverless via AWS Lambda to train a recommending system. I am currently working as an undergraduate researcher/Software Engineer within the Paesani Research Group under Professor Francesco Paesani. My main responsibility is to design and create extrapolation systems for computational chemistry. I am also working as a Part-Time Software Engineer Intern at HouseCall Pro. Recently, I developed an interest and self study in data science. In my recent project financial dataset, I want to create a dataset that allows the user to have quick access to financial data, and I am planning to develop an api to allow user query financial data.

~~I do Leetcode in my freetime~~

My Favorite Linux Command is:
```
rm -R ./*

## Professional Experience
**_Software Engineer Intern, Housecall Pro | Jan 2021 - Present_**

**_Undergraduate Researcher/Software Engineer, UCSD - Paesani Research Group | Oct 2020 – Present_**
- Algorithmic optimization for Computational Chemistry research group
- Wrote backend Python code to compute and optimize linear extrapolation of a large data set, reduced the
extrapolation runtime from minutes to seconds
- Created a text parser in Python to parse and extract energy from the extrapolation
- Altered an outdated Python function to perform bulk extrapolation for multiple energies instead of a
single energy
- Wrote SQL code to Integrate the linear extrapolation function into the database of the MB-Fit project

**_Software Engineer Intern, Moonshot Innovation | Jun 2020 – Aug 2020_**
- Wrote and deployed NodeJS async backend code and Serverless via AWS Lambda to train a
recommendation system
- Implemented a data lake that includes data ingestion and ETL process that allows event tracking,
ingestion, transformation and loading to store user interaction data with the company website
- Deployed AWS Glue and JSON classifiers to classify the data collected from AWS Lambda before storing it
to AWS S3 bucket for training

## Project Experience
**Snitchat** | NodeJS, Express, Socket.io, React | _Sep 2020 – Dec 2020_
- Built a full-stack web app to create school-specific chat rooms to allow students to chat anonymously
- Built the backend server and the router using the Express framework
- Supported real-time chatting by using Socket.io to communicate between the client and the server
- Used the React framework to design and render the front-end client of the web app

**Financial Dataset** | Python, SQL, Unix | _May 2020 – Sep 2020_
- Set up and designed a relational database on AWS RDS hosting following database normalization
- Wrote backend SQL, Python, and Unix code to get up-to-date financial instrument data from Yahoo Finance API and executed CRUD relational database operations
- Queried the Alpaca API to populate the relational database with historical financial instrument data
- Integrated SQLAlchemy and Object-Relational Mapping to uphold object-oriented design and to populate bulk data to the database asynchronously

**Quaranteen** | PHP, SQL | _May 2020 – Jul 2020_
- Built the backend of a web app for students to socialize during the COVID-19 pandemic by writing PHP and SQL code to populate/query data to a relational database on AWS RDS

**LinkedHouse** | Swift | _Mar 2020 – May 2020_
- Collaborated with friends to develop an iOS App for students to find off-campus roommates on XCode
- Wrote backend Swift code to save/query data using the Parse Server API and deployed the App on Heroku
