## Background
I am currently a Junior studying Math - Computer Science at UC San Diego. My background is primarily in backend development, and I have experience in different programming languages, including Java, Python, C, C++, and SQL. I also have experience working with Amazon web services. Last summer, I worked as a software engineer intern at a startup, where I wrote and deployed Node.js async backend code and Serverless via AWS Lambda to train a recommending system. I am currently working as an undergraduate researcher/Software Engineer within the Paesani Research Group under Professor Francesco Paesani. My main responsibility is to design and create extrapolation systems for computational chemistry. I am also working as a Part-Time Software Engineer Intern at HouseCall Pro. Recently, I developed an interest and self study in data science. In my recent project financial dataset, I want to create a dataset that allows the user to have quick access to financial data, and I am planning to develop an api to allow user query financial data.
